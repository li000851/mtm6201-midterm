                <p>At SweetEscape we have been mastering the ancient art of sourdough breadmaking for more than 20 years.</p>
                <p>SweetEscape sourdough bread is created by hand from Australian flour, filtered water, sourdough culture and sea salt. These simple ingredients combine across a traditional 30-hour fermentation and proofing process, and each loaf is shaped by hand before being baked on the stone floor of the oven. Every loaf is an individual expression of the baker’s hands: no two loaves are ever the same.</p>
